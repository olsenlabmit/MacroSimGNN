MacroSimGNN is a graph neural network model designed for efficient and accurate calculation of macromolecule pairwise similarity. Traditional methods like graph edit distance are precise but computationally intensive, while graph kernel methods are faster but less accurate. MacroSimGNN strikes a balance by delivering high accuracy with significantly improved computational efficiency.

Key features include:
- **Pairwise Graph Similarity:** Accurately computes macromolecule similarity for cheminformatics applications.
- **Land Mark Distance Embeddings:** Generates embeddings based on macromolecular similarities to a set of landmark molecules, enhancing both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks.
- **Versatility:** Facilitates the development of advanced database search engines and predictive tools for macromolecular design.

This repository provides tools and models for researchers and developers aiming to advance macromolecular cheminformatics with cutting-edge machine learning methods.
